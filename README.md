Home Automation System


The Home Automation System (HAS) is a stand-alone system consisting of modular components, sensors and actuators, that can be added or removed as needed. While the system is able to operating without external inputs required, it has optional features that extend its functionality using external data sources and interfaces. For instance, an external weather reporting feed or a web-based interface connected through a networked API.
